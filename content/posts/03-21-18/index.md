Hello, everyone, and welcome to my new and improved blog.  Okay, so it really isn't new, and it's not _that_ improved, but it needed a fresh start.  I took some design inspiration from [Medium](https://medium.com) as far as text width, and I just picked some colors I liked, and here we are.

## Anyway, here's what you can expect
I really don't believe I'll be able to post consistent, long articles, so you'll probably wind up receiving a bunch of shorter, but hopefully helpful, articles about Javascript, React, and CSS.  I also think I'll be writing some posts about mental health, like how to deal with what you're going through, how to help others, and just some general advice to make your life a little bit better.

## What not to expect:
I won't be posting groundbreaking ways of doing things or intentionally motivational posts.  This is just going to be a place for me to write, and if it helps you out in any way, that makes it all worth it.

## And now, what I really wanted to tell you:
So as I was re-coding this site, I thought back to one question that I've gotten repeatedly on Instagram: "How do I get experience?". Well, one of the best ways to do that is through open source software, and then it hit me.

## Why not make my blog open source?!
That's right, this entire website is going to be open source.  Everyone will be able to contribute in different ways.  If I post some slightly incorrect code in one of my articles, you can submit a PR to help me fix it.  If you have any ideas on how I can improve the design and usability of the site, you'll be able to post your ideas and we'll be able to discuss things.  Post Ideas, CSS Bugs, features you would like to see, these are all things that will be up for discussion on the GitHub repo.

## Help me help you help myself
That's all for now, so here's a link to the [Github repo](https://github.com/tallestthomas/tomrasmussen) and as always, you can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tallestthomas) or on
[Instagram]( https://instagram.com/tallestthomas ).<br /><br/>

Looking forward to your contributions, cheers!
